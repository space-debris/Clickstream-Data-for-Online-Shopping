This project explores a comprehensive dataset from an online clothing store for pregnant
women, capturing intricate clickstream data over five months in 2008. The dataset’s
multivariate and sequential nature provides a rich ground for classification, with a focus on
understanding if the price of a particular product is higher than the average price for the entire
product category. It comprises 165,474 instances across 14 distinct features, including
product categories, photo locations, and pricing details. Our analysis aims to uncover price
classification among different product categories being bought by pregnant women in Poland
and other European countries. The insights derived could serve as a strategic tool for
e-commerce platforms to optimise user experience and enhance business performance. The
dataset, licensed under CC BY 4.0, encourages further research and application in the realm
of business analytics.
